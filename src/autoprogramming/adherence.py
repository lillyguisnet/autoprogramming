"""Approach adherence checks for implementation-only Pi workers.

A portfolio avenue is an experiment in one implementation mechanism.  A worker
may make that mechanism robust, or report that its environment blocks it, but it
must never quietly replace it with another tier merely to return a working
function.  This module provides the deterministic half of the pre-import gate;
the Pi controller adds an independent semantic review because source heuristics
alone cannot establish architectural intent.
