"""Data handling: normalize any accepted source into rows, split once, guard access.

On ``optimize()`` the data is split exactly once into train/val/test. This
module turns sources into uniform rows, computes an order-independent identity
hash, performs the deterministic split, and exposes the splits with the
discipline the README promises: train is readable, val is scoring-only, and
test is not reachable from here at all.
